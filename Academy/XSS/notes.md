# XSS: Cross-Site Scripting
is the fact of injecting Javascript code with a vulnerable html page.

Tree types of XSS atacks

-> STORED : when the code is stored on the backend server.

-> REFLECTED : Occurs when user input is displayed on the page after being processed by the backend server, but without being stored 

-> DOM-BASED : Another Non-Persistent XSS type that occurs when user input is directly shown in the browser and is completely processed on the client-side, without reaching the back-end server.

So in other words, Reflected XSS is processed on the back end server but not stored, however, the DOM based, is processed only on the client side.
